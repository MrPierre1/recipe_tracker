# my-project

> A Vue.js project

>I wanted to learn Vuejs, and so I build a recipe tracker.This is a basic app that allows CRUD operations on recipes you added. The code is not perfect and I could do a better job if I went back and refactor everything.Now that I understand components, state management and routing a little better, I'm going to build something smaller with better code quality(with tests included)
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Start json-server to get the existing meal data
json-server users.json

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
